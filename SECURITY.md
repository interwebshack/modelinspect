# Reporting Security Issues

The AI Forensics team and community take security bugs in `aiforensics` seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security issue, please use the GitHub Security Advisory ["Report a Vulnerability"](https://github.com/interwebshack/aiforensics/security/advisories/new) tab.

The AI Forensics team will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, the security team will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.

Please include the requested information listed below (as much as you can provide) to help us better understand the nature and scope of the possible issue:

- Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)  
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue  
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)  
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue  
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue  
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)  
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue  

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.
