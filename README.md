# Model Inspect  
Model Inspect is a tool for inspecting the contents of Ai Models.  

## Limitations & Alternatives

`modelinspect` currently only examines [pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) models.  More to come in future versions.  
You might want to check alternatives such as [ModelScan](https://github.com/protectai/modelscan).
