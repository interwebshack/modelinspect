# SafeTensors File Format Analysis (AI Forensics)

This document explains the structure of [Safetensors](https://github.com/huggingface/safetensors#safetensors) files and how **AI Forensics** safely inspects `.safetensors` files by analyzing metadata, verifying structure, and detecting potentially malicious or unsafe content ‚Äî all without executing any model code.

## SafeTensors Format Overview  

The `.safetensors` format is purpose-built for storing AI model weights in a **secure, efficient, and deterministic** way.  It was developed to address the security concerns around formats like `.pt` or `.pkl`, which can execute arbitrary Python code during loading ‚Äî a serious attack surface in untrusted environments.

**Key characteristics of SafeTensors:**

* Stores tensors in a **simple binary format**  
* Avoids using Python object serialization (like `pickle`)  
* Guarantees **no code execution risk** during loading ‚Äî making it safe for use in security-sensitive or forensic workflows  
* Supports **zero-copy memory-mapping** for fast and efficient tensor access
* Includes a **JSON-based header** containing metadata such as tensor names, shapes, and data types  

## üì¶ SafeTensors File Layout

```text
+----------------------+----------------------+-------------------+
|  Header Length (u64) |      Header JSON     |     Tensor Data   |
+----------------------+----------------------+-------------------+
       (8 bytes)         (Header Length bytes)    (remaining bytes)
```

### 1. Header Length (u64)

- First 8 bytes of the file.
- Unsigned 64-bit little-endian integer.
- Indicates length (in bytes) of the JSON header that follows.

### 2. Header (JSON)

- UTF-8 encoded metadata describing tensors.
- Maps tensor names to dictionaries with:
  - `dtype`: e.g., `"F32"`, `"I64"`, `"BF16"`
  - `shape`: list of ints (e.g., `[1000, 512]`)
  - `data_offsets`: two integers indicating the start and end offset in the tensor data section

Example:

```json
{
  "model.weight": {
    "dtype": "F32",
    "shape": [256, 256],
    "data_offsets": [0, 262144]
  },
  "__metadata__": {
    "format": "pt",
    "quantization": "none"
  }
}
```

### 3. Tensor Data

- Raw binary tensor data.
- Stored in the order defined by offsets in the header.
- Not compressed or encoded ‚Äî direct memory-mapped layout.

## üìò Supported Dtypes

| Dtype  | Description            | Bytes per Element |
|--------|------------------------|-------------------|
| `F16`  | 16-bit float           | 2                 |
| `F32`  | 32-bit float           | 4                 |
| `F64`  | 64-bit float           | 8                 |
| `I8`   | 8-bit signed int       | 1                 |
| `U8`   | 8-bit unsigned int     | 1                 |
| `I16`  | 16-bit signed int      | 2                 |
| `I32`  | 32-bit signed int      | 4                 |
| `I64`  | 64-bit signed int      | 8                 |
| `BF16` | bfloat16               | 2                 |

## ‚úÖ AI Forensics Validation Checklist

### Header Integrity

- Verifies first 8 bytes match length of UTF-8 JSON
- Confirms JSON is valid and parseable
- Confirms all keys have `dtype`, `shape`, and `data_offsets`
- Checks `__metadata__` structure (if present)

### Tensor Shape & Size

- Confirms `shape √ó dtype size == offset size`
- Validates offset bounds against file length
- Flags overlapping or missing tensor regions

### Binary Heuristics & Threat Detection

- Flags ghost tensors (in header but no data)
- Flags tensors with misaligned or huge size (>2GB)
- Detects use of suspicious dtypes (`U8` for model weights)
- Flags malformed or spoofed metadata

### Metadata Integrity

- Validates known fields in `__metadata__`
- Compares against allowlist of expected keys (e.g., `format`, `quantization`, `producer`)
- Records unknown fields for reporting
